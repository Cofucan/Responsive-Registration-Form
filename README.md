# Registration Form

For some reason, my png background does not render when hosted on Github pages but it renders on my computer locally. I have not been able to find a solution.

There is no Javascript in this code. I was able to use come CSS tricks to make the input error appear under the input and it dissappears when the correct data type is entered. But that means it will always display immediately the page is loaded until the user enters their data.  

From my research, Javascript is needed to make it hidden and only show when the user enters invalid data, then it dissappears when the user clears the data.
